## Quick Start

Get up and running in under 5 minutes:

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install vlm-code-context-mcp

# 2. Set up your project
npx code-context-mcp setup .

# 3. Start the dashboard
npx code-context-dashboard ./context.db

# Dashboard opens at http://localhost:3333
```

That's it! Your codebase is now indexed and ready for AI-assisted development.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20, 22, or 24
- npm or yarn
- An AI client that supports MCP (Claude Code, Cline, Continue.dev, etc.)

### Install via npm

```bash
npm install vlm-code-context-mcp
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
npx code-context-mcp --help
```

You should see the setup and dashboard commands listed.

---

## First-Time Setup

### Step 1: Initialize Your Project

Run the setup command in your project root:

```bash
npx code-context-mcp setup .
```

This creates:
- `context.db` — SQLite database with indexed code
- `.mcp.json` — MCP client configuration
- `.claude/` directory (if using Claude Code)

**Expected output:**
```
=== Code Context MCP — Setup (my-project) ===

[1/4] Initializing database...
[2/4] Indexing target directory...
  Indexed 174 files, 328 exports, 59 dependencies.
[3/4] Seeding factory defaults...
  Seeded 7 agents, 5 skills
[4/4] Configuring MCP client...
  Wrote .mcp.json

=== Setup complete! ===
```

### Step 2: Restart Your AI Client

After setup, **restart your AI client** (Claude Code, VS Code, etc.) to load the new MCP tools.

### Step 3: Verify Tools Are Loaded

Ask your AI assistant:

> "Call `get_project_status`"

You should see a response like:
```
Files indexed: 174
Agents: 7
Sprints: 0
Tickets: 0
Project is set up and ready.
```

---

## Understanding the Dashboard

The dashboard provides a live view of your project's scrum process. Open it with:

```bash
npx code-context-dashboard ./context.db
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3333`

### Dashboard Tabs

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Sprints** | View all sprints with status, velocity, and progress |
| **Tickets** | Kanban board with all tickets organized by status |
| **Team** | View agent roster, roles, and mood trends |
| **Epics** | Track progress on epics and milestones |
| **Planning** | Interactive wizard for sprint planning |
| **Retro** | View retrospective findings and patterns |

### Real-Time Updates

The dashboard uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to update in real-time. When you or an AI agent makes changes via MCP tools, the dashboard refreshes instantly without page reload.

---

## Your First Sprint

### Option 1: Guided Walkthrough (Recommended)

Use the `/kickoff` command for a fully guided experience:

```
/kickoff
```

Your AI assistant will:
1. Ask about your product vision
2. Help you create a milestone
3. Break down work into epics
4. Plan your first sprint with tickets
5. Guide you through implementation
6. Run a retrospective
7. Archive completed work

**Advantages:**
- No prior knowledge needed
- AI enforces all QA gates
- Best practices applied automatically
- Nothing gets left dangling

### Option 2: Manual Sprint Creation

If you prefer manual control:

#### 1. Create a Milestone

```javascript
await create_milestone({
  name: "M1 — MVP",
  description: "Minimum viable product with core features",
  status: "active"
});
```

#### 2. Create Epics

```javascript
await create_epic({
  name: "User Authentication",
  description: "Login, signup, and password recovery",
  milestone_id: 1,
  priority: 1,
  color: "#3b82f6"
});
```

#### 3. Start a Sprint

```javascript
await start_sprint({
  name: "Sprint 1 — Auth",
  goal: "Complete user authentication flow",
  milestone_id: 1,
  epic_id: 1,
  velocity: 19,
  tickets: [
    {
      title: "Create login form",
      description: "Build login UI with email/password",
      assigned_to: "fe-engineer",
      story_points: 5,
      priority: "P1"
    },
    {
      title: "Implement login API",
      description: "POST /api/auth/login endpoint",
      assigned_to: "be-engineer",
      story_points: 5,
      priority: "P1"
    },
    {
      title: "QA: Test login flow",
      description: "Verify login works end-to-end",
      assigned_to: "qa",
      story_points: 1,
      priority: "P1"
    }
  ]
});
```

#### 4. Advance to Implementation

```javascript
await advance_sprint({ sprint_id: 1 });
```

#### 5. Work Through Tickets

For each ticket:
```javascript
// Start work
await update_ticket({ ticket_id: 1, status: "IN_PROGRESS" });

// ... do the work ...

// Mark complete
await update_ticket({
  ticket_id: 1,
  status: "DONE",
  qa_verified: true,
  verified_by: "qa"
});
```

#### 6. Complete Sprint

```javascript
await advance_sprint({ sprint_id: 1 });
```

This moves the sprint to `done` phase, then to `rest`.

## Common Workflows

### Finding Code

**Search for a specific symbol:**
```javascript
await find_symbol({ name: "useAuth" });
// Returns: Files exporting useAuth with summaries
```

**Get full context for a file:**
```javascript
await get_file_context({ path: "/home/user/project/src/hooks/useAuth.ts" });
// Returns: Exports, imports, dependents, metadata, change history
```

**Search files by pattern:**
```javascript
await search_files({ query: "%test%" });
// Returns: All files with "test" in path or summary
```

### Managing Tickets

**Create a new ticket:**
```javascript
await create_ticket({
  sprint_id: 1,
  title: "Add password reset",
  description: "User can reset password via email",
  assigned_to: "be-engineer",
  story_points: 3,
  priority: "P2"
});
```

**Link ticket to epic:**
```javascript
await link_ticket_to_epic({
  ticket_id: 5,
  epic_id: 2
});
```

**Set up ticket dependencies:**
```javascript
await add_dependency({
  source_ticket_id: 5,
  target_ticket_id: 1,
  dependency_type: "blocked_by"
});
// Ticket 5 is now blocked by ticket 1
```

### Blockers and Bugs

**Report a blocker:**
```javascript
await create_blocker({
  sprint_id: 1,
  description: "API rate limiting preventing testing",
  ticket_id: 3,
  escalated_to: "devops"
});
```

**Log a bug:**
```javascript
await log_bug({
  sprint_id: 1,
  severity: "HIGH",
  description: "Login fails with special characters in password",
  ticket_id: 2,
  steps_to_reproduce: "1. Enter password with !@#\n2. Click login",
  expected: "User is logged in",
  actual: "Error: Invalid password"
});
```

### Retrospective

**Add retro findings:**
```javascript
await add_retro_finding({
  sprint_id: 1,
  category: "went_well",
  finding: "Frontend and backend synced perfectly on API contract",
  role: "fe-engineer"
});

await add_retro_finding({
  sprint_id: 1,
  category: "try_next",
  finding: "Set up API contract testing before implementation",
  role: "qa",
  action_owner: "qa"
});
```

**Analyze patterns across sprints:**
```javascript
await analyze_retro_patterns();
// Returns: Category breakdown, recurring issues, action follow-through rate
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No MCP tools available"

**Cause:** AI client not connected to MCP server.

**Solutions:**
1. Restart your AI client completely
2. Verify `.mcp.json` exists in your project root
3. Check that `context.db` exists

### "File not in index"

**Cause:** Trying to query a file that hasn't been indexed.

**Solution:**
```javascript
await index_directory({ path: "/home/user/my-project" });
```

### "Stale dist" errors

**Cause:** Compiled JavaScript doesn't match TypeScript source.

**Solution:**
```bash
npm run build
```

Then restart your AI client.

### Dashboard shows no data

**Cause:** Wrong database path or database not initialized.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify database exists
ls -la context.db

# Re-run setup if needed
npx code-context-mcp setup .
```

### High memory usage

**Cause:** Large codebases with many files.

**Solutions:**
1. Index only the directories you need:
```javascript
await index_directory({ path: "/home/user/project/src" });
```

2. Exclude node_modules and build artifacts (automatic by default)

### Sprint gate warnings

**Cause:** Trying to advance sprint phase with incomplete work.

**Common warnings:**
- "No tickets assigned" → Add tickets with `create_ticket`
- "Tickets still in progress" → Mark them DONE or BLOCKED
- "Tickets need QA verification" → Set `qa_verified: true`

**Solution:** Address the specific warnings, then retry `advance_sprint`.

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Index Before Querying

Always index your codebase before querying:
```javascript
// First time or after big changes
await index_directory({ path: "/home/user/project" });

// Then query
await find_symbol({ name: "useAuth" });
```

### 2. Set Descriptive File Descriptions

Help your AI (and yourself) by adding descriptions:
```javascript
await set_description({
  path: "/home/user/project/src/auth.ts",
  description: "Authentication utilities: login, logout, session management"
});
```

### 3. Link Tickets to Epics

Keep work organized by linking tickets:
```javascript
await link_ticket_to_epic({
  ticket_id: 5,
  epic_id: 2
});
```

### 4. Use QA Gates

Don't skip QA verification:
```javascript
await update_ticket({
  ticket_id: 5,
  status: "DONE",
  qa_verified: true,  // Always verify
  verified_by: "qa"
});
```

### 5. Track Time

Enable better velocity forecasting:
```javascript
await log_time({
  ticket_id: 5,
  estimated_hours: 4,
  actual_hours: 5
});
```

### 6. Document Discoveries

In discovery sprints, log findings:
```javascript
await create_discovery({
  sprint_id: 2,
  finding: "Authentication state management needs refactoring",
  resolution_plan: "Migrate to React Context with useReducer",
  category: "architecture",
  priority: "P1"
});
```

### 7. Monitor Agent Mood

Track burnout risk:
```javascript
await record_mood({
  agent_id: 3,
  sprint_id: 5,
  mood: 2,  // Low mood = potential burnout
  workload_points: 13,
  notes: "Heavy backend load, consider redistribution"
});
```

### 8. Regular Backups

Export your database periodically:
```javascript
await export_to_file({ output_path: "./backup/context-$(date +%Y%m%d).json" });
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Custom SQL Queries

For complex queries not covered by built-in tools:
```javascript
await query({
  sql: `
    SELECT s.name, COUNT(t.id) as ticket_count,
           SUM(CASE WHEN t.status = 'DONE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as done_count
    FROM sprints s
    LEFT JOIN tickets t ON t.sprint_id = s.id
    GROUP BY s.id
    ORDER BY s.id DESC
  `
});
```

### Bulk Updates

Update multiple tickets efficiently:
```javascript
await execute({
  sql: "UPDATE tickets SET status = ? WHERE sprint_id = ? AND assigned_to = ?",
  params: ["TODO", 5, "developer"]
});
```

### Integration with CI/CD

Add to your CI pipeline:
```bash
# Index code
npx code-context-mcp index . || echo "Index failed"

# Run tests
npm test

# Export results for analysis
npx code-context-dashboard export context.db > results.json
```
