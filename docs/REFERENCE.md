## Skill sets (server-provided)

The server ships three predefined skill libraries — **Frontend** (22 skills: React 19 / Vue 3 scaffolding, routing, state, forms, auth, i18n, testing, accessibility, performance, design systems, motion, PWA, plus an editable **house-style primer**), **Landing pages** (structure, SEO, lead capture, content audits), and **Workflow** (write-pull-requests, write-commit-messages).

Unlike a plugin, these are **served by the MCP server into your live session**, not copied into your repo. `/kickoff` asks once which sets to enable (frontend is on by default; `update_skill_sets` changes it any time). When a sprint has `fe-engineer` work, `load_phase_context` injects the house-style primer and the enabled skill indexes — workflow skills inject for every implementer; your agent then pulls any skill's full guidance on demand with `get_skill({ name })`. No restart, no files to manage.

| | |
|---|---|
| Source | [`claude_development_skills`](https://github.com/VelimirMueller/claude_development_skills) — vendored under `vendor/skills/` (build input) |
| Storage | seeded into the project DB `skills` table (`fe:*`, `la:*`, `wf:*`); **edit them to make them yours** — re-seeds never overwrite your edits |
| Opt-in | `/kickoff` Phase 1b asks once; `update_skill_sets({ landing: true, ... })` any time |
| Trigger | fe/la on `fe-engineer` tickets, wf on any implementation work during `/kickoff` |
| Load | index + primer up front; full body via `get_skill({ name })` |
| Update | opt-in boot-time sync from the latest upstream release (`CODE_CONTEXT_SKILLS_AUTOSYNC=1`); `npm run sync:skills` re-vendors the offline fallback |

## The agent team

9 configurable agents, each with a role, model, and mood score. Dev roles default to the strongest model (`claude-fable-5`), QA to `claude-opus-5`; the rest use `claude-sonnet-5`. Change a model, tools or system prompt with the `update_agent` MCP tool or in the dashboard.

| Role | Focus |
|---|---|
| Product Owner | Vision, priorities, stakeholder alignment |
| Team Lead | Coordination, code review, quality |
| Architect | System design, technology decisions, structural integrity |
| Backend Developer | APIs, database, server logic |
| Frontend Developer | Dashboard components, UI/UX |
| Developer | Full-stack features across frontend and backend |
| QA Engineer | Testing, verification, quality gates |
| Security Engineer | Vulnerability review, threat modeling, security best practices |
| DevOps | CI/CD, builds, deployment |

Add, remove, or swap models through MCP tools or with a single click in the dashboard — and the choice **routes execution**: during `/kickoff` and `/sprint`, each ticket is implemented by a subagent spawned at its assigned agent's model tier (`fable`/`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`).

Since 2.0, tickets can carry **multiple agents with per-assignment model overrides**: the lead implements, supporting agents verify the diff in parallel from their role's perspective, and the QA gate requires every verdict before a ticket counts as done.

## Sprint process

4 phases with enforced gate checks:

```
planning → implementation → done → rest
```

| Phase | Duration | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| **Planning** | 1 day | Tickets assigned, velocity committed |
| **Implementation** | 3 days | All tickets DONE or NOT_DONE, blockers resolved |
| **Done** | 0.5 day | Retro findings recorded, QA verified |
| **Rest** | 0.5 day | Automatic after retro |

Phases, durations, and gates are fully customizable via `update_sprint_config`.

Since 2.0, planning is **gated**: `start_sprint` and `advance_sprint` refuse to proceed while untriaged retro `try_next` findings or escalated open discoveries (P0/P1 older than 3 sprints) exist — triage them, or override explicitly with `acknowledge_open_items: true`. Retro learnings stop being write-only.

Since 2.2, the QA gate also checks **commit discipline**: a ticket can't reach `qa_verified` while its referencing commits lack the `Why:/What:/How:` body groups — and closes feed the burndown automatically.

## Release highlights

### New in 2.8 — Python in the Index 🐍

- **`find_symbol` and the dependency graph work for Python repos.** `.py`/`.pyi` files now get `exports` rows and `dependencies` edges: module-level `def`/`async def`, `class` and `UPPER_CASE =` constants, with the first docstring line as description. `_`-prefixed names are skipped unless `__all__` lists them; `__all__` filters the list.
- **Imports resolve inside the repo.** `import a.b`, `from .mod import x`, multi-line `from` imports and `from . import mod` resolve to `<path>.py` or `<path>/__init__.py` from the repo root or `root/src`; stdlib and third-party imports land in `external_imports`. Regex-based like the JS/TS parsers, no new dependencies; JS/TS behaviour is unchanged.
- **Skill sync follows the claude_development_skills 0.7.0 layout.** The `workflow` set now reads `skills/core/` (names stay `wf:*`), so the `wf:` rows no longer freeze at 0.6.0. `scripts/sync-skills.mjs` vendors only the catalogues `skill-set-registry.json` names.

### New in 2.7 — Archive Milestones & Epics 🗄️

- **Done is out of sight** — completed milestones and epics can be archived like sprints: `update_milestone` / `update_epic` take `archived: true` (`force: true` for unfinished work), and `archived: false` brings them back.
- **Lists stay short** — `list_epics` and the new `list_milestones` hide archived rows unless `include_archived: true`; the Planning page tucks them into a collapsed **Archived** section with one-click **Archive** / **Unarchive**.
- **Safe upgrade** — schema v24 only adds a nullable `archived_at` column to both tables; nothing existing is archived.

### New in 2.6 — Fresh Index 🧊

- **Answers are checked against the disk.** `search_files`, `find_symbol` and `get_file_context` stat every row they return: a changed file is re-indexed and a deleted one dropped *before* the answer goes out, and each row carries its `indexed_at`. Per repo, a moved git `HEAD` re-indexes exactly the files `git diff --name-only <indexed>..HEAD` lists and says so in one `⚠ STALE` line; above 500 changed files it warns on every call instead of blocking.
- **Only your code is indexed.** Git checkouts are listed with `git ls-files` (every `.gitignore`, at any depth), on top of a hard deny: `node_modules`, `vendor`, `dist`, `build`, `.next`, `coverage`, Laravel `storage/`, dot-dirs (`.git`, `.worktrees`), lockfiles, minified bundles, source maps, binaries, files over 512 KB (`CODE_CONTEXT_MAX_FILE_KB`).
- **`code-context-reindex`** re-indexes every repo under a root: `[--all | <repo>…] [--root <dir>] [--db <file>] [--prune-missing] [--vacuum]`. A `.code-context-ignore` file in a repo keeps it out (and purges its rows). Exit 0/1.
- **Fewer tools in context.** The gamification (`record_mood`, `get_mood_trends`, `generate_vision_animation`) and the dashboard live-output stream (`send_step_progress`, `send_claude_output`, `send_claude_step`) are hidden unless `CODE_CONTEXT_TOOLSETS=fun,stream` (or `all`). No data is removed.

### New in 2.4 — Roster Control 🎛️

- **`update_agent`** — change a role's model, tools, system prompt, name, description or department from a single MCP call, and the reply names the Task-tool tier the new model routes to. No raw SQL and no dashboard detour. The sprint instructions used to advertise a `create_agent` tool that never existed; they now point here.
- **One model catalog** — `claude-opus-5` is offered and accepted everywhere, and seeds the QA role. `KNOWN_AGENT_MODELS` is the single source of truth the dashboard re-exports, so server and UI can no longer drift; `claude-opus-4-8` joins `claude-sonnet-4-6` as a legacy id that still renders and edits.
- **`assigned_to` is validated** — a model or provider name such as `opus` or `glm` used to find no agent and route silently to the sonnet fallback. Both ticket tools now reject anything that is not a roster role and point at `impl:*` tags for the runtime.

### New in 2.3 — Current-Gen Models & Hardening 🧭

- **Sonnet 5 defaults** — support roles seed on `claude-sonnet-5`; the dashboard offers the full current generation (Fable 5 / Opus 4.8 / Sonnet 5 / Haiku 4.5) from one shared model catalog, and Fable agents finally render (and are pickable) everywhere.
- **Reset tools un-broken** — `reset_agents`/`reset_skills` no longer crash with `require is not defined`, and a reset preserves agent departments.
- **Backups you can trust** — `--force` checkpoints the WAL before renaming and uses SQLite-pairable backup names, so the `.bak` alone holds every committed write.
- **Groomed fatal errors** — a DB from a newer version refuses the boot with a clean two-line error (no stack trace, no stray `-wal`/`-shm` files), and `--help` finally tells the truth about setup-vs-update.

### New in 2.2 — Discipline & Telemetry 📐

- **Commit contract, injected and enforced** — delegated implementation prompts carry the `Why:/What:/How:` commit-body contract (derived live from the `wf:write-commit-messages` skill), and `update_ticket` refuses `qa_verified` while a ticket's commits don't follow it — offending hashes named, docs-only tickets exempt, always fail-open.
- **Telemetry without ceremony** — closing a ticket auto-snapshots the burndown and can log `actual_hours` against the assigned agent; phase transitions snapshot too. Retros quote real numbers instead of `0h`.
- **Leaner internals** — `tools.ts` and `dashboard.ts` both decomposed into domain modules (dashboard server −37%), with byte-identical tool/route surfaces pinned by mutation-verified parity tests.
- **Claude Fable 5 tier** — dev roles default to `claude-fable-5`; ticket routing gains the `fable` tier.

### New in 2.0 — Process 2.0 🚦

- **Planning gates that close the retro loop** — sprints refuse to start while retro `try_next` learnings sit untriaged; adopt, drop, or defer each one (`triage_retro_finding`), and adopted items auto-flag as applied when their ticket lands.
- **Honest velocity** — commitment freezes when implementation starts; mid-sprint scope shows as `+added / removed` instead of inflating completion rates.
- **Terminal cockpit** — tools render width-locked progress cards in colored ```diff fences, and the `code-context-statusline` bin puts a live sprint HUD in Claude Code's status line at zero token cost.
- **Live-editable board + session reaction** — edit tickets on the dashboard; the Claude session sees a `⚠ CHANGED TICKETS` diff block and acknowledges your changes.
- **Multi-agent tickets** — several agents per ticket with per-assignment model overrides: the lead implements, supporters verify in parallel, QA aggregates the verdicts.
