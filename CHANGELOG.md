# Changelog

All notable changes to `vlm-code-context-mcp` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Stale index rows for deleted files (`index_directory` prune)** — the indexer upserted every file it found but never removed rows for files deleted from disk, so `search_files`/`find_symbol` kept returning ghosts until a manual SQL sweep (observed in the wild: a 104-file dead-code purge left 311 ghost file rows, 643 orphaned exports and 154 dangling dependency edges across re-indexes). `indexDirectory` now diffs the scanned path set against stored rows and deletes files and directories that vanished — scoped to the indexed root so indexing a subdirectory never evicts sibling rows, with export/dependency child rows removed explicitly (no reliance on the caller's `foreign_keys` pragma), and pruned files recorded as `delete` events in the changes log (that branch of `diffAndLogChanges` was previously unreachable). Stats gain `prunedFiles`/`prunedDirs`; the `index_directory` summary reports the prune when nonzero. The dashboard file-watcher re-index inherits the fix.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- **Commit discipline, enforced end-to-end (Sprint 28)** — with the workflow skill set enabled, `load_phase_context({ phase: "implementation", ticket_id })` appends a compact **Commit contract** block (subject convention + the `Why:/What:/How:` body template + trailer note) to the Model-routing directive, derived **live** from the stored `wf:write-commit-messages` skill — edit the skill and the injected contract follows, no second copy. At close, `update_ticket` **refuses `qa_verified: true`** while branch commits referencing the ticket ref lack the three labeled body groups: the ⛔ message names the offending hashes with an amend-vs-squash remediation hint. Zero referencing commits → exempt (docs/process tickets never block); merge commits exempt; missing git/repo/base branch → fail-open skip. (`buildCommitContract`, `checkCommitFormat`)
- **Auto-telemetry on ticket close (Sprint 29, adopts try_next #122)** — `update_ticket` transitioning a ticket to DONE auto-snapshots sprint metrics through the new shared `snapshotSprintMetrics` helper (the `snapshot_sprint_metrics` tool now routes through the same path), `advance_sprint` snapshots at every phase transition, and `update_ticket` accepts **`actual_hours`**, recorded against the ticket's assigned agent via the same column `log_time` writes. Burndown and time reports populate from normal ceremony flow — no manual snapshot ceremony. Telemetry writes are fail-open (`[audit]` to stderr; they can never block or roll back a close).
- **Claude Fable 5 model tier** — `modelToTier` maps `claude-fable*` to the new `fable` tier for subagent routing; `fe-engineer`/`be-engineer`/`developer` defaults move to `claude-fable-5` (QA stays on `claude-opus-4-8`, pinned by test); the dashboard model picker lists Fable 5 as "Most capable".

### Changed
- **tools.ts decomposed (Sprint 27, discovery #16)** — new shared data-access layer `src/scrum/queries.ts` (sprint/ticket lookups deduplicated); the analytics (7 reporting tools) and skills (6 tools) handlers extracted byte-identical into `src/scrum/tools/{analytics,skills}.ts` behind `registerAnalyticsTools`/`registerSkillsTools` — tool surface unchanged. The skill-set registry is single-sourced into `src/scrum/skill-set-registry.json`: the TS server imports it, `compile-skills.mjs` fs-reads it (it runs pre-tsc), and a mutation-verified parity test guards derivation drift between the two readers.
- **dashboard.ts decomposed, slice 1 (Sprint 29, discovery #17)** — the stalled `handlers/` migration revived along its own documented plan: code-intel routes (`handlers/code.ts`) and the full scrum API domain including `PATCH /api/ticket/:id` (`handlers/sprint.ts`) moved out via the registry barrel; `dashboard.ts` drops **2,350 → 1,473 lines** with a byte-identical route surface, pinned by a 76-route golden parity test (`test/dashboard-route-parity.test.ts`, sentinel-404 mechanism, mutation-verified).

### Fixed
- **Silent audit-trail loss around `event_log` writes (Sprint 27)** — 5 bare `catch {}` sites (`update_sprint`, `update_ticket` ×2, `log_bug`, `start_sprint`) now log `[audit] <context>: <error>` to stderr instead of swallowing the failure; the primary mutation still commits, the trail loss becomes visible. Regression-tested including the forced-failure stderr path.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Landing + workflow skill sets, served & opt-in (discovery #21)** — the vendored `landing/` (build-landing-page, set-up-seo, set-up-lead-capture, audit-content-quality, audit-copy-compliance) and `workflow/` (write-pull-requests, write-commit-messages) categories are now compiled, seeded, and boot-synced alongside frontend, as `la:*` / `wf:*` skills. Serving is **per-project opt-in**: new **`update_skill_sets`** tool (partial update; missing config = frontend-only, so existing projects are unchanged), `get_skill` refuses disabled sets with an enable hint, `/kickoff` gains **Phase 1b** asking which predefined sets to enable (AskUserQuestion, resume-aware via the new `skill_sets` line in `get_resume_state`). Enabled sets index into implementation phase context: landing rides the Frontend Playbook; workflow injects once per sprint for every implementer.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-11

**Process 2.0** — one consolidated release for Sprints 22–24 plus the skill auto-sync and infrastructure work landed the same day (the 1.4.0–1.6.0 entries that briefly existed here were PR-stage versions, never tagged or published).

**Why a major version:** behavior and defaults changed. Several tools now return compact output unless `verbose: true` is passed, `get_file_context` no longer includes change history by default, sprint ceremonies can **refuse** to proceed (planning gates on `start_sprint` / `advance_sprint`, overridable with `acknowledge_open_items`), and the dashboard can no longer set tickets to DONE or `qa_verified` — completion is process-controlled behind the QA gate.

### Added
- **Planning gates that close the retro loop** — try_next retro findings now have a lifecycle (`open`/`adopted`/`dropped`, migration v21). The new **`triage_retro_finding`** tool adopts a finding into a ticket (auto-flagged applied when that ticket lands), drops it with a reason, or defers it for one planning cycle. `start_sprint` **refuses to start** while untriaged try_next findings or escalated open discoveries (P0/P1 older than 3 sprints) exist — `acknowledge_open_items: true` overrides, explicitly. `load_phase_context({ phase: "tickets" })` injects the open-items blocks with a triage directive, and `analyze_retro_patterns` reports real triage/applied rates instead of the always-0% owner metric.
- **Honest velocity** — `advance_sprint` runs the planning gate on planning → implementation (pre-created sprints can no longer bypass it) and **freezes `velocity_committed` at gate passage**. Added/removed scope is derived (`getScopeDeltas`) and reported in `get_velocity_trends` and `export_sprint_report` as `committed (+added / removed)`; completion rates measure against the frozen commitment, so 100% is earnable, not guaranteed.
- **Real recurring-issue analysis** — `analyze_retro_patterns` clusters went_wrong findings (stopword-filtered unigrams/bigrams, recurring = present in ≥2 distinct sprints, bigram-shadowing) instead of counting words. "because (5x)" can no longer be a top issue.
- **Design Language 2.0 — server-rendered terminal cards** (`src/scrum/cards.ts`): `update_ticket`, `advance_sprint`, `start_sprint`, `get_sprint_playbook`, and `get_burndown` accept `format: "card"` and return a pre-rendered, width-locked card (progress bar, burndown sparkline, ticket counts, warning lines) inside a ready-to-print ```diff fence — `+` lines render green, `-` warnings red in Claude Code. Cards include compact state inline, eliminating the follow-up `get_ticket` round-trip (discovery #12).
- **`code-context-statusline`** — new bin for Claude Code's `statusLine`: reads the session payload from stdin, finds `context.db` upward from the workspace, and prints a one-line ANSI sprint HUD (phase, day, points bar, ticket counts, blockers, mood) with zero token cost. Setup gains a merge-safe `[7/7]` step that wires it into `.claude/settings.json` without clobbering an existing statusline. Honors `NO_COLOR`; never breaks the host UI.
- **AskUserQuestion-native `/kickoff`** — every enumerable choice (discovery type, backlog confirmation, gate triage, archive decisions) goes through Claude Code's native question UI with a wizard → AskUserQuestion → plain-text fallback chain; server cards render verbatim; new **Phase 5b — Planning Gate Triage**. All hand-drawn ASCII boxes removed (441 → 243 lines).
- **Dashboard live mirror** — `start_sprint`, `advance_sprint`, `update_ticket`, and `create_ticket` auto-emit typed `step_progress`/`entity_changed` events server-side, so the wizard timeline follows terminal-driven ceremonies with zero extra LLM tool calls.
- **Token diet** (discoveries #8–#11, #13): `list_discoveries` compact by default (open items, truncated one-liners; `verbose: true` for everything), `get_burndown` shows the last 5 snapshots by default, `get_sprint_playbook` drops the lifecycle tutorial after the third sprint, the retro mood query aggregates in SQL, the frontend house-style primer injects only with the sprint's first fe ticket, and `get_file_context` `include_changes` defaults to **false**. Measured on the canned ceremony replay (`scripts/measure-tokens.mts`): **2807 → 1702 output tokens (−39%)**.
- **Live-editable board tickets with session reaction** — tickets are fully editable from the dashboard (`PATCH /api/ticket/:id`: title, description, points, priority, status within TODO ↔ IN_PROGRESS ↔ BLOCKED, assignments). Every UI edit transactionally bumps `change_seq`, sets the **`pending_change` flag**, writes a field-level `ticket_revisions` diff, queues a `ticket_changed` bridge action, and emits SSE (migration v23). The Claude session reacts: `load_phase_context(implementation)` and `get_sprint_playbook` prepend a **`⚠ CHANGED TICKETS`** block with per-field diffs, and the new **`acknowledge_ticket_changes`** tool clears the flags once the session has adjusted.
- **Multi-agent ticket assignments with per-assignment model selection** — `ticket_assignments` (role, optional model override, lead flag; existing `assigned_to` backfilled as lead). `create_ticket`/`update_ticket` accept `agents: [{ role, model?, lead? }]` (exactly one lead, validated roles/models, replace-set; the single-agent path keeps working and re-points the lead). The routing directive becomes **`Model routing (multi-agent)`**: the lead implements via a subagent at its resolved model, supporting assignments verify in parallel at theirs, and the QA gate requires every supporting verdict. Dashboard ticket editor gains agent chips with star-to-lead and a per-assignment model dropdown; board cards render assignment chips lead-first.
- Inline ticket editing UI: click-to-edit title/description in the detail modal, quick-edit from board cards and table rows, optimistic updates reconciled from the PATCH response, server 400s reverted and surfaced.
- **Boot-time skill auto-sync** — the server syncs the `fe:*` skill set from the latest upstream skills release on boot, so new skill releases reach existing installs without a package update.
- **Canonical fresh-install schema + downgrade guard** — `initScrumSchema` creates the final schema directly (absorbing migrations v6–v23), and fresh databases are **baseline-stamped** at `LATEST_SCHEMA_VERSION` instead of replaying all 23 migrations. Parity is enforced two ways: structurally against the incremental path, and against **real legacy databases** — pre-versioning / v1.2.1 / v1.3.1 SQL fixtures generated from git history (`scripts/make-legacy-fixture.mts`), each proven to migrate without error, preserve data, reach structural parity, and stay idempotent. Opening a database written by a newer server fails fast instead of risking corruption.
- **Setup update mode — existing databases are never overridden**: running `code-context-mcp` on a project that already has a `context.db` now does **migrate + config repair only**. Schema migrations run with an automatic rolling `context.db.bak` backup when migrations are pending (with a WAL-checkpoint warning if another process is writing, and a pointer to the backup if a migration fails); then `.mcp.json`, the bridge hook, commands, and statusline are refreshed idempotently. No re-indexing, no re-seeding, no wizard — a `[1/2]`/`[2/2]` update flow replaces the 7-step pipeline. The MCP server reports `[schema] vN` on stderr at boot.
- **Stale-dist warning** (adopts Sprint 1's try_next): `get_resume_state` and `health` warn when `src/` is newer than the compiled `dist/` — the silent-missing-tools failure mode is now announced.
- **Benchmark hygiene** (adopts Sprint 19's try_next): benchmark tests write to tmpdir by default; tracked result JSONs only update with `BENCHMARK_WRITE_RESULTS=1`. `npm test` leaves a clean tree.
- **Commands-structure CI check** (adopts Sprint 5's try_next): `npm run check:commands` validates `.claude/commands/*` (phase headers, rules, output contracts, no box-drawing, line ceiling) and runs in CI.

### Changed
- `/kickoff` Phase 7 documents multi-agent delegation (lead implements first, supporters review the diff in parallel, failed verdicts mean `log_bug()` and back to the lead); `/retro` documents the try_next lifecycle (capture at retro, adopt/drop/defer decision at the next planning, gate-enforced).
- `code-context-mcp --force` renames the old database (and its `-wal`/`-shm` siblings) to `context.db.bak-<timestamp>` instead of deleting it — a full reset is now recoverable.
- Vendored skill set updated to claude_development_skills v0.5.1.
- CI: GitHub Actions bumped to Node 24-ready majors (checkout v6, setup-node v6, create-pull-request v8); sync-skills cron unblocked (repo setting allowed Actions to create PRs).

### Fixed
- **Silent audit-trail loss** (migration v22): `event_log`'s CHECK constraints rejected `retro_finding`/`triaged` rows and the catch-and-ignore pattern hid it. The table is rebuilt with extended constraints; triage audit inserts are no longer silenced.
- **`tickets.review_status` only existed on dashboard-touched databases** — the column was created by an ad-hoc dashboard patch while migration v7 was a false no-op, so server-only databases were missing it. The migration engine now owns `review_status` (and the `deleted_at` safety net); the dashboard's ad-hoc ALTERs are gone.
- **Pre-2.0 databases could lose all tickets during migration**: with `foreign_keys = ON` (the production default), the v5 `sprints` rebuild's `DROP TABLE` fired `ON DELETE CASCADE` into `tickets` and `retro_findings`. FK enforcement is now disabled around the migration transaction (the canonical SQLite pattern) and restored afterwards. Oldest-era databases also crashed during init on a missing `deleted_at` column. Both failure modes are pinned by the legacy fixture suite.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Sprint archiving** — finished sprints (status `closed`/`rest`/`done`) can be archived from the dashboard: Archive/Unarchive button in the sprint detail header (with an `Archived` badge), plus a bulk **"Archive all completed (n)"** action in the sidebar behind a confirm dialog. Archived sprints move behind the sidebar's "Show Archive" toggle and stay out of default views while remaining in **all metrics** (velocity trends, retro aggregation, insights). Unarchive restores them unchanged.
- New nullable `archived_at` column on `sprints` (migration v20) — orthogonal to `status` and `deleted_at`, so archiving never rewrites sprint history.
- Three dashboard endpoints behind the existing bearer auth: `POST /api/sprint/:id/archive` (400 unless the sprint is finished — eligibility is enforced server-side), `POST /api/sprint/:id/unarchive`, and `POST /api/sprints/archive-completed` (single-transaction bulk, returns `{ archived: n }`). Every archive/unarchive writes an audit-trail event, so changes appear in the activity feed.

### Changed
- The sidebar archive section is now driven by the explicit `archived_at` flag instead of the implicit "milestone completed + all sprints closed/rest" heuristic. This also fixes `done`-status sprints never counting as finished in the old grouping.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Server-provided frontend skills** — the frontend skill set is now served by the MCP server straight into a live `/kickoff` session instead of being copied into each project. When a sprint has `fe-engineer` work, `load_phase_context` injects a house-style primer plus an index of available skills; the agent pulls any skill's full body on demand via the new **`get_skill`** tool. No restart, no slash-skill registration.
- **`get_skill({ name })`** — read tool returning one skill's full content from the DB (e.g. `fe:set-up-auth`, or a companion/shared ref like `fe:set-up-auth/auth-patterns.md` / `fe:_shared/<file>`).
- **`seedFrontendSkills()`** — idempotently seeds the frontend skills + the editable `fe:_house-style` primer into the project DB `skills` table (`owner_role: 'fe-engineer'`); per-skill insert-if-absent, so your edits survive re-seeds.
- **`npm run compile:skills`** (`scripts/compile-skills.mjs`) — compiles the vendored `vendor/skills/frontend/**` into `src/scrum/frontend-skill-defaults.generated.ts`, shipped compiled in the package.
- **Per-agent model routing via subagent delegation** — each ticket's implementation is delegated to a subagent spawned (Task tool) at its assigned agent's model tier (`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`). `load_phase_context` (implementation) and `get_ticket` emit a **Model routing** directive, and the `/kickoff` and `/sprint` flows act on it. This is what makes a ticket's assigned-agent model actually take effect (the dashboard model field was previously advisory only).

### Changed
- Frontend skills now live in the server DB (single source of truth, editable per project) rather than as files in your repo. Vendored source moved from `skills/` to `vendor/skills/` (build input only); `package.json` `files[]` no longer ships it.
- `setup` no longer copies skills into `.claude/skills/`; the former step is removed (setup is now a 6-step flow). Skills are seeded into the DB by `seedDefaults`.
- Agent model defaults updated to current IDs: `fe-engineer`, `be-engineer`, `developer`, and `qa` default to the strongest model (`claude-opus-4-8`); other roles use `claude-sonnet-4-6`. The dashboard model picker and `/api/agent` validation now offer `claude-opus-4-8`, replacing the outdated `claude-opus-4-6`.

### Fixed
- Dashboard `SprintPlanningView` had a malformed conditional (`cond ? (<jsx/>)` with no `:` branch) that failed the TypeScript parser and ESLint; completed it as a `cond && (<jsx/>)` render. `npm run lint` now reports 0 errors.

### Removed
- The `.claude/skills/<skill>/` file-copy install (added in 1.2.0) and the dead `src/server/skills-install.ts`.

### Notes
- Existing projects may still have `.claude/skills/<frontend-skill>/` files from 1.2.0 — these are harmless leftovers and can be deleted; the server no longer manages them.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-06-09

### Security
- **Path traversal in the indexer (#14)** — `resolveImportPath()` now rejects any import resolving outside the project root (containment check via `path.relative`), and `index_directory` enforces a sandbox: only `process.cwd()` is indexable by default, extended via `CODE_CONTEXT_ALLOWED_ROOTS`. Prevents reading arbitrary files (e.g. `~/.ssh`) into the queryable store.
- **SQL injection in `query`/`execute` (#15a)** — replaced the keyword denylist with allowlist validators plus better-sqlite3's `stmt.reader` check (`src/server/sql-guard.ts`). `query` accepts only a single read-only `SELECT`/`WITH` (no stacked statements, comments, or CTE-prefixed writes); `execute` accepts only a single `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`. Closes the semicolon, comment, and subquery bypasses.
- **Unauthenticated dashboard API (#15b)** — all `/api/*` routes now require a bearer token (`Authorization` header, or `?token=` for the SSE stream). The token is auto-generated and persisted to a gitignored `.code-context/dashboard.token` (override with `CODE_CONTEXT_DASHBOARD_TOKEN`), injected into the served page for the same-origin app, and sent by the MCP server on its notify calls. The page and static assets stay public so the browser can bootstrap.

### Removed
- **npm publish workflow** (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) — releases are now git tag + GitHub release only; the package is not published to npm.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Bundled frontend skills** — the 22 Claude Code skills from [`claude_development_skills`](https://github.com/VelimirMueller/claude_development_skills) now ship inside the package (`skills/`). `code-context-mcp setup` installs them into the project's `.claude/skills/<skill>/`, so Claude Code discovers them automatically. Existing skill files are never overwritten.
- **`npm run sync:skills`** (`scripts/sync-skills.mjs`) — re-vendors the skills from the plugin repo's `main` and records provenance in `skills/.source.json` (source, ref, commit, timestamp, count).
- **Scheduled sync workflow** (`.github/workflows/sync-skills.yml`) — runs daily and on demand; re-vendors the skills and opens a PR whenever upstream `main` changes.
- **User-perspective install test** (`test/skills-package-install.test.ts`) plus a CI step validating that `skills/.source.json` `skillCount` matches the actual `SKILL.md` count.

### Changed
- `package.json` `files[]` now ships the `skills/` directory.
- `setup` is now a 7-step flow with a new "Installing Claude skills" step; step labels normalized.

### Notes
- Skills install **flat** at `.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`. Claude Code discovers project skills one level deep, so the upstream `frontend/` domain wrapper is stripped on install while `_shared/` is kept as a sibling so the skills' `../_shared/` references still resolve.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- Package description still referenced "7-agent scrum team" — now ships with 9 agents (Security Engineer + Architect added in 1.1.2)

## [1.1.2] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Security Engineer** and **Architect** agent roles — 7→9 default agents. Existing 7-agent databases auto-migrate on startup.
- Benchmark JSON files (`benchmark-results.json`, `benchmark-stochastic-results.json`) now included in npm package

### Changed
- Setup no longer auto-creates "M1 — Getting Started" milestone — milestones are created via `/kickoff` or MCP tools for a clean starting state

### Fixed
- **Flaky CI benchmark test** — "larger tasks save more" assertion compared group totals (4 small vs 3 large tasks) instead of per-task averages, causing failures on CI where indexer output differs slightly across Node versions

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **10-task deterministic benchmark** (`test/benchmark.test.ts`) — MCP vs vanilla comparison across 6 categories (retrieval, analysis, exploration, implementation, debugging, refactoring), 32 story points total. Replaces the old 3-task hand-estimated comparison. Outputs `benchmark-results.json` for dashboard consumption.
- **200-trial stochastic benchmark** (`test/benchmark-stochastic.test.ts`) — random file role assignment, Poisson exploration noise (λ=1.5), Wilcoxon signed-rank test, bootstrap 95% CI, seeded PRNG for reproducibility. Result: 90.5% MCP win rate, p < 0.001, effect size r=0.953.
- **Benchmark guide** (`BENCHMARK-GUIDE.md`) — methodology, task descriptions, how to add tasks, honest reporting guidelines
- `/api/benchmark` and `/api/benchmark-stochastic` dashboard endpoints serving new benchmark data
- `benchmarkStore` (Zustand) for fetching deterministic + stochastic results

### Changed
- **Benchmark dashboard page** rewritten — now shows 10-task card grid, category breakdown, statistical proof panel with Wilcoxon results, hypothesis testing, and per-template savings
- **README benchmark section** updated with reproducible numbers (44.9% token savings, 27.9% fewer calls, p < 0.001) and `npm test` commands to verify

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-15

### Removed
- **Velocity tab** — removed `Velocity` page, `velocityStore`, `/api/velocity` endpoint, and navigation entry. Sprint velocity data (committed/completed points, badges) remains available on sprint cards and Gantt chart.

### Fixed
- `comparison.json` now ships in npm package and dashboard falls back to bundled copy when not found next to database — fixes empty Benchmark page on npm installs

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Composite database indexes on `tickets(sprint_id, deleted_at)` and `sprints(status, deleted_at)` for faster soft-delete queries
- Migration v19 for existing databases to add ticket composite index
- `DASHBOARD_PORT` env var support in dashboard.ts (previously only accepted CLI arg)

### Changed
- **Transactional database operations** — `runMigrations`, `start_sprint`, `update_ticket`, and `advance_sprint` now wrap multi-step writes in `db.transaction()` for atomicity; partial failures roll back cleanly
- **Token efficiency** — `get_file_context` output consolidated (removed redundant `Indexed` timestamp, merged metadata to single line, removed dependency summaries); `index_directory` output reduced structural padding
- Version bumped to 1.0.0 for launch readiness
- ESLint `no-console` rule enabled (warn level, allowing `warn`/`error`)
- All documentation reconciled: tool count 76/81/83 → 93, agent count 9/16 → 7, stale sprint/ticket/milestone numbers removed from LAUNCH.md
- Setup and dashboard console output now respects `DASHBOARD_PORT` env var instead of hardcoding `localhost:3333`

### Fixed
- `retro_findings.linked_ticket_id` FK now uses `ON DELETE SET NULL` (fresh installs)
- Sprints table rebuild (`sprints_v3` migration) now always includes `deleted_at` column — previously dropped by migration 5 and never restored, causing broken `velocity_trends` view on fresh databases
- Removed 5 noisy debug `console.log` statements from dashboard.ts (SSE change notifications, re-index, marketing stats rebuild, client connect)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- `update_sprint_config` and `get_sprint_config` MCP tools for runtime sprint configuration
- `department` field on agents (development, quality, business) for team organization
- Agent mood history seeding with per-sprint workload data on first startup
- TeamGrid dashboard component now displays agent department badges

### Changed
- Default agent team updated from 4/6/15-agent presets to a focused 7-agent roster (FE Engineer, BE Engineer, Developer, DevOps, QA, Team Lead, Product Owner)
- Agent seed migration auto-detects and upgrades old 4-, 6-, and 15-agent factory defaults
- Dashboard `/api/comparison` endpoint returns live benchmark data from `comparison.json`

### Fixed
- Agent reset validation now asserts exactly 7 agents and 5 skills after re-seed

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Benchmark comparison interface** — new `Benchmark` page visualizing MCP vs traditional development metrics (token usage, context switches, tool calls, completion time)
- **Velocity tracking** — new `Velocity` page with sprint-over-sprint throughput charts (story points completed, planned vs actual, trend lines)
- `comparisonStore` (Zustand) for fetching and caching benchmark data from `/api/comparison`
- `velocityStore` (Zustand) for fetching sprint velocity trends from `/api/velocity`
- Benchmark and Velocity tabs added to the top navigation
- `comparison.json` data file for persisting MCP vs traditional run results
- Dashboard API routes: `/api/comparison` and `/api/velocity`

### Changed
- Navigation updated to include Benchmark and Velocity as top-level tabs
- README updated with benchmark findings and efficiency metrics

#### Scrum System
- 9-agent virtual scrum team (later refined to 7: FE Engineer, BE Engineer, Developer, DevOps, QA, Team Lead, Product Owner)
- 4-phase sprint process: Planning → Implementation → Done → Rest
- Sprint process stored as configurable skill (`SPRINT_PROCESS_JSON`)
- Agent assignment to tickets with workload tracking
- SQLite-backed persistence for all scrum data (sprints, tickets, epics, milestones, discoveries, mood history)

#### Infrastructure
- `code-context-mcp` CLI with `--help`, `--force`, `--name` flags for project setup
- `code-context-dashboard` CLI binary for launching the dashboard server
- `postinstall` script for npm — shows setup hint when installed as a dependency
- Automatic port detection — finds next open port when 3333 is blocked
- CI pipeline with ESLint, Prettier, and Husky pre-commit hooks
- 58+ unit tests (Vitest) covering MCP tools and dashboard API
- 23 Playwright E2E tests covering all dashboard tabs
- BentoGrid made fully dynamic — no hardcoded project data on clean installs
- Claude Code bridge hook for bidirectional dashboard–Claude communication

### Changed
- Dashboard architecture migrated from single HTML file to component-based React app with atomic design (atoms → molecules → organisms → pages)
- Sprint phases simplified from multi-step ceremony model to 4 clear phases
- Default agent count reduced from 15 to 4, then made configurable (assignment optional)
- Navigation flattened to single-level with persistent quick actions
- Standardized API error responses across all dashboard endpoints
- Removed Linear integration code (external dependency eliminated for MVP)
- Removed Marketing section from dashboard

### Fixed
- API response shape mismatches that crashed the React dashboard
- SSE plain-text event handling for live reload
- Milestone loading from skill content and vision fetch
- Sprint sorting by status then date in Gantt timeline
- File tree default collapsed state with auto-expand on search
- `dragLeave` flicker in kanban drag-and-drop
- Object-shaped `imports`/`importedBy` handling in Code Explorer detail tab
- Null safety guards in Code Explorer to prevent crashes
- Ticket milestone/epic assignment and discovery archiving
- Team workload/mood and Retro tab reactivity

### Removed
- 461 lines of dead and duplicated code identified and cleaned up
- Original single-file HTML dashboard (replaced by React app)
- Linear integration (all external sync code removed)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added

#### MCP Server
- SQLite-backed codebase indexer — scans and indexes file metadata, exports, imports, and dependencies
- `index_directory` — recursively index a project directory into the SQLite database
- `get_file_context` — retrieve file metadata, exports, imports, and dependency graph
- `find_symbol` — search for symbols (functions, classes, variables) across indexed files
- `search_files` — full-text search across indexed file content and descriptions
- `get_changes` — track file changes grouped by path with size and line diffs
- `query` / `execute` — raw SQL access to the underlying SQLite database
- `set_description` — set a human-readable description for any indexed file
- `set_directory_description` — set a description for any indexed directory
- `set_change_reason` — annotate why a file changed
- Pre-indexed file and folder descriptions written automatically on first install
- Relative path support for portable project references

#### Dashboard
- HTML-based dashboard with file tree browser and detail panel
- Directory and file description display in the detail panel
- Portfolio-aligned styling and design

#### Infrastructure
- TypeScript codebase with Vitest test suite (parser and smoke tests)
- `better-sqlite3` for zero-dependency embedded database
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` integration for MCP server protocol
- `chokidar` file watcher for detecting changes
- `zod` schema validation
