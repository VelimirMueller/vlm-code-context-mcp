# Changelog

All notable changes to `vlm-code-context-mcp` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.3] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **10-task deterministic benchmark** (`test/benchmark.test.ts`) — MCP vs vanilla comparison across 6 categories (retrieval, analysis, exploration, implementation, debugging, refactoring), 32 story points total. Replaces the old 3-task hand-estimated comparison. Outputs `benchmark-results.json` for dashboard consumption.
- **200-trial stochastic benchmark** (`test/benchmark-stochastic.test.ts`) — random file role assignment, Poisson exploration noise (λ=1.5), Wilcoxon signed-rank test, bootstrap 95% CI, seeded PRNG for reproducibility. Result: 90.5% MCP win rate, p < 0.001, effect size r=0.953.
- **Benchmark guide** (`BENCHMARK-GUIDE.md`) — methodology, task descriptions, how to add tasks, honest reporting guidelines
- `/api/benchmark` and `/api/benchmark-stochastic` dashboard endpoints serving new benchmark data
- `benchmarkStore` (Zustand) for fetching deterministic + stochastic results

### Changed
- **Benchmark dashboard page** rewritten — now shows 10-task card grid, category breakdown, statistical proof panel with Wilcoxon results, hypothesis testing, and per-template savings
- **README benchmark section** updated with reproducible numbers (44.9% token savings, 27.9% fewer calls, p < 0.001) and `npm test` commands to verify

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-15

### Removed
- **Velocity tab** — removed `Velocity` page, `velocityStore`, `/api/velocity` endpoint, and navigation entry. Sprint velocity data (committed/completed points, badges) remains available on sprint cards and Gantt chart.

### Fixed
- `comparison.json` now ships in npm package and dashboard falls back to bundled copy when not found next to database — fixes empty Benchmark page on npm installs

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Composite database indexes on `tickets(sprint_id, deleted_at)` and `sprints(status, deleted_at)` for faster soft-delete queries
- Migration v19 for existing databases to add ticket composite index
- `DASHBOARD_PORT` env var support in dashboard.ts (previously only accepted CLI arg)

### Changed
- **Transactional database operations** — `runMigrations`, `start_sprint`, `update_ticket`, and `advance_sprint` now wrap multi-step writes in `db.transaction()` for atomicity; partial failures roll back cleanly
- **Token efficiency** — `get_file_context` output consolidated (removed redundant `Indexed` timestamp, merged metadata to single line, removed dependency summaries); `index_directory` output reduced structural padding
- Version bumped to 1.0.0 for launch readiness
- ESLint `no-console` rule enabled (warn level, allowing `warn`/`error`)
- All documentation reconciled: tool count 76/81/83 → 93, agent count 9/16 → 7, stale sprint/ticket/milestone numbers removed from LAUNCH.md
- Setup and dashboard console output now respects `DASHBOARD_PORT` env var instead of hardcoding `localhost:3333`

### Fixed
- `retro_findings.linked_ticket_id` FK now uses `ON DELETE SET NULL` (fresh installs)
- Sprints table rebuild (`sprints_v3` migration) now always includes `deleted_at` column — previously dropped by migration 5 and never restored, causing broken `velocity_trends` view on fresh databases
- Removed 5 noisy debug `console.log` statements from dashboard.ts (SSE change notifications, re-index, marketing stats rebuild, client connect)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- `update_sprint_config` and `get_sprint_config` MCP tools for runtime sprint configuration
- `department` field on agents (development, quality, business) for team organization
- Agent mood history seeding with per-sprint workload data on first startup
- TeamGrid dashboard component now displays agent department badges

### Changed
- Default agent team updated from 4/6/15-agent presets to a focused 7-agent roster (FE Engineer, BE Engineer, Developer, DevOps, QA, Team Lead, Product Owner)
- Agent seed migration auto-detects and upgrades old 4-, 6-, and 15-agent factory defaults
- Dashboard `/api/comparison` endpoint returns live benchmark data from `comparison.json`

### Fixed
- Agent reset validation now asserts exactly 7 agents and 5 skills after re-seed

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Benchmark comparison interface** — new `Benchmark` page visualizing MCP vs traditional development metrics (token usage, context switches, tool calls, completion time)
- **Velocity tracking** — new `Velocity` page with sprint-over-sprint throughput charts (story points completed, planned vs actual, trend lines)
- `comparisonStore` (Zustand) for fetching and caching benchmark data from `/api/comparison`
- `velocityStore` (Zustand) for fetching sprint velocity trends from `/api/velocity`
- Benchmark and Velocity tabs added to the top navigation
- `comparison.json` data file for persisting MCP vs traditional run results
- Dashboard API routes: `/api/comparison` and `/api/velocity`

### Changed
- Navigation updated to include Benchmark and Velocity as top-level tabs
- README updated with benchmark findings and efficiency metrics
