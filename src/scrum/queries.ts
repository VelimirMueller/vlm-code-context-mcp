/**
 * Data-access helpers for the duplicated sprint/ticket lookups in tools.ts.
 *
 * Discovery #16 flagged 8+ inline copies of `SELECT * FROM sprints WHERE id=?`
 * plus repeated tickets-by-sprint, latest-active-sprint, ticket-by-id, and
 * per-sprint status-count queries. These helpers centralise only the exact,
 * mechanically-identical query strings so call sites in tools.ts stay
 * behaviour-for-behaviour the same — no caching, no new column selection, no
 * altered filters. Each helper uses per-call `db.prepare(...)` exactly as the
 * original sites did (better-sqlite3 caches the prepared statement internally,
 * so semantics are unchanged).
 *
 * Rows are returned as minimal typed interfaces for the columns call sites
 * actually read; SELECT * helpers carry an index signature so the full row
 * remains accessible (the original code casts every row to `any`).
